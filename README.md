## FAQ's:-

##### What is Next.js?

React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js".Where traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.
##### What is Sanity Studio?

The Studio comes with advanced features that lets you tailor workflows for your editors. You can also install and make plugins for Sanity Studio and publish them on npm.
##### What is Redux?
> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
##### What is Tailwind CSS?
> Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.
